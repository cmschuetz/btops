# btops

bspwm desktop management that supports dymanic appending, removing, and renaming

## Introduction

Often times a workflow for a given day can't be defined by a set number of desktops with constant names.  Btops enables you to define your workspaces based on what you're doing so you don't have worry about things like putting your applications in their respective desktops, running out of desktops, or leaving desktops unused and empty.

## Examples

#### Dynamic with classified renamers

## Configuration

btops supports config files in toml, json, and yaml format.  It'll look in the following places for config files:

```
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/btops/config.*
~/.config/btops/config.*
```

Below are the different configuration options available.  Please look at [examples](https://github.com/cmschuetz/btops/tree/master/examples) for example usage
